      <h2>Factors to Consider When Choosing High-Traffic Flooring</h2>
      <div class="mb-6">
        <h3>1. Wear Layer Thickness</h3>
        <p>For vinyl flooring, look for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>12-20 mil: Residential high traffic</li>
          <li>20+ mil: Commercial grade</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Surface Texture</h3>
        <p>Consider textured surfaces that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hide minor scratches and wear patterns</li>
          <li>Provide better slip resistance</li>
          <li>Mask dust and dirt between cleanings</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Color and Pattern</h3>
        <p>Strategic choices can help manage the appearance of wear:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Medium tones show less dirt than very light or dark colors</li>
          <li>Patterns and variations hide scratches better than solid colors</li>
          <li>Wood looks with grain patterns excel at concealing wear</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
