      <h2>What's the Best Type of Vinyl Flooring?</h2>
      <p>If you're installing vinyl flooring, you'll have two main choices: Glue-down vinyl flooring and click-lock floating vinyl flooring. But which one is best for your home, lifestyle, and budget?</p>

      <h2>Glue-Down Vinyl Flooring</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>✔ Permanently adheres to the subfloor</li>
        <li>✔ Great for high-traffic and commercial spaces</li>
        <li>✔ Requires more prep work and adhesive application</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Click-Lock Vinyl Flooring</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>✔ Floating floor system – no glue required</li>
        <li>✔ Easier to install & remove if needed</li>
        <li>✔ More forgiving over slightly uneven subfloors</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Which One Should You Choose?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>For DIY projects:</strong> Click-lock vinyl is easier.</li>
        <li><strong>For maximum durability:</strong> Glue-down is best for heavy foot traffic.</li>
        <li><strong>For rental properties or future changes:</strong> Click-lock is removable and replaceable.</li>
      </ul>
